# MERGE

MERGE is a memory game that hopes to educate learner drivers of UK Road Signs in a fun, purposeful way. MERGE is targeted towards learner drivers and is a memory card matching game in which users have to match images of the road signs to their definitions. MERGE will be useful to learner drivers as it will create an addictive, fun space to learn the road signs in order to eventually pass their theory test.

### Content

- The Code Institute course tutorials have been imperative when creating this game. Namely, the [Love Maths Tutorial] (<https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+CPJS_06_20+2020_T1/courseware/8f9b28d4b7664bb59ddf18b8e090671f/87791688b88e46099e3a77f455419aa8/>)
- [Google Fonts's] (<https://fonts.google.com/>) Martian Mono, monospace was used for the title and text of the game.
- I used [Coolors] (<https://coolors.co/palette/fa0707-ffa600-52d600-ffffff-e2e2e2>) to generate a colour palette. My palette is a simple one that includes traffic light colours in keeping with the road theme.
- [Favicon] (<https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/>) was used to create the game's Favicon
- In order to assist in creating this README.md, I used [this] (<https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template>) template.
- [User Stories Guide] (<https://github.com/awkale/user-story-best-practice/blob/master/README.md>)
- Tutorials!!!!!!

### Media

- The traffic signs and their definitions were taken from [Gov.uk's Highway Code Traffic Signs] (<https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/58170307ed915d61c5000000/the-highway-code-traffic-signs.pdf>)
- I created the image of the car and the favicon merge sign using [Procreate] (<https://procreate.com/>)
